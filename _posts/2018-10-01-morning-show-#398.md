We rarely do this, but [the latest episode](https://goodstuff.fm/morningshow/398) of [Morning Show](http://goodstuff.fm/morningshow) was recorded at the dining table at my parents house with Kenny and I in the same room. Kenny was the only one who was monitoring levels making it the only episode of the show where I couldn't hear it as we were recording.

It had been a few weeks since we had recording _anything_, so I'm glad we were able to record this weekend.

We've got a cross-over planned with Andrew and Nick at [Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Brewed](https://www.sosnsbsbpodcast.com/) next week!
