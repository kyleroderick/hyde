Well, satellite internet is a bust. Getting speeds of .2 Mbps down with rain and cloud cover. Diagnostic from the company has green lights all the way down, but speed tests say otherwise. When I'm getting a fraction of a percentage of normal speeds, there's absolutely no way I'd ever recommend this service to anyone.
