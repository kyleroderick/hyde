[Three Trapped Tigers](https://3trappedtigers.bandcamp.com/ "Three Trapped Tigers") and solo act Adam Betts put out one of [my favorite EPs of 2016](https://adambetts.bandcamp.com/album/colossal-squid) and this new live track is absolutely incredible. The vocals add so much to the vibe even through frantic rides and fills, but I think even more interestingly: watching the sequence triggers hooked up to cymbals and drums and how they fire when hit is mesmerizing.
