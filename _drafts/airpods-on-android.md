Apple's AirPods _might_ be my gateway back into the world of iOS. I've been on Android for a few years, but given the chance to use an Apple accessory with my preferred handset, I jumped at the chance. The shape of the headphone is my prefered in-ear headphone behind the now discontinued [Urbanear Medis](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/682821-REG/Urbanears_4090023_Medis_Stereo_Earbud_Headphones.html). Unfortunately, they can't be used with my phone and my Mac at the same time like they can with an iOS device. So for now I'll continue to toggle my various bluetooth antennae.
