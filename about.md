* I live in California with my wife and 9 cats.
* I've been recording, producing, and running a podcast network with [Chris](https://twitter.com/ichris) called Goodstuff since 2014. We work with a small group of talented hosts and producers to create entertaining podcasts.
* In July 2016, I joined the team at [Untappd](https://untappd.com) as a UI/UX Designer. You can see my current work on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/untappd-discover-beer/id449141888?mt=8) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.untappdllc.app&hl=en_US).
